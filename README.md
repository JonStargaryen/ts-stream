The aim of this project was to employ TypeScript on a problem where the language can really shine: i.e. a Java 8 
inspired Stream API.

Implementation details (e.g. using mixins and native iterators) are taken from [Sequency](https://github.com/winterbe/sequency).
Refer to that project if you are looking for a mature implementation of lazily evaluated streams in TypeScript.
